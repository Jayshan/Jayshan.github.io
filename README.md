This is my first attempt at initilazing a Git repository from the terminal, and actually "commiting"(?) my test project files as well.
I really don't know what I'm doing, so this is just practice for a potential job in the future.
Let's hope I can look back at this one day and laugh at how far I've come.
頑張ってください！ 

Looks like I managed to connect my Git repo to my GitHub account. Step 1 complete?

Going to try another addition and then commit.
